## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add, edit, and delete tasks  
- 🔄 Persistent data using **localStorage**  
- ⏱️ Simulated API requests with **Promises** and `setTimeout`  
- ⚡ Built with **Vite** for blazing-fast development  
- 🧩 Component architecture following atomic design principles  
- 🎨 Styled with **TailwindCSS** and **class-variance-authority (CVA)**  
- 🌐 Navigation with **React Router**  
- 💬 User feedback with loading states and skeleton components  


## 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced

This project was part of my React learning path and focuses on strengthening foundational skills such as:

- React componentization and state management  
- Context API for sharing data between components  
- Routing between multiple pages  
- Reusable UI components with dynamic styling using CVA  
- Handling async behavior and loading feedback  
- Data persistence with localStorage  
- Clean, consistent, and responsive design
